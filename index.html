        <h1>My Philosophy</h1>
        <h3>Expressing Gratitude</h3>
        <p>
          I can always find something to appreciate and when I do, I express my gratitude. What's so wonderful is that the more I express my gratitude, the more I find to appreciate. Sometimes, a single breath is all it takes. A state of gratitude sets me more at ease and helps me focus more on that which I want instead of what I don’t want. Gratitude brings a good feeling which proliferates more of the same way of thinking and behavior. With gratitude as a foundation, I can generally re-frame any circumstance, event, or relationship in a positive way.
        </p>
        <h3>Taking Responsibility​</h3>
        <p>
          By taking responsibility for my feelings, attitude, and actions, I feel more empowered. I can focus on the causes that are within myself for a given outcome. I can reflect on my feelings, behavior, attitude, and thoughts to realize that most of the causes for an outcome lie within myself. I can then work on the factors for which I have control instead of focusing on factors for which I have little or no control.
        </p>
        <h3>Constantly Improving</h3>
        <p>
          I consistently seek knowledge and find ways to apply what I learn.  I've realized the importance of appreciating the successes at hand while always striving to learn more and constantly improve.  I tend to seek balance while continually pushing the boundaries to a measured amount that keeps me within a believable goal.  It’s about knowing the risk and understanding our fears, while taking the action necessary that will lead me to a better state.  It’s a desire to improve myself and to help others become better in some way.
        </p>
        <h3>Being Positive</h3>
        <p>
          By thinking and visualizing a positive outcome that is both believable and attainable, I tend to experience positive emotions.  It is about my expectations: If I believe and expect good things to happen, then my attitude, behavior, and actions will support the expectations.  I will be open to the changes that will positively affect my life and the lives of others. I realize the importance of having an understanding, compassionate, and kind attitude toward others while having high expectations of myself.
